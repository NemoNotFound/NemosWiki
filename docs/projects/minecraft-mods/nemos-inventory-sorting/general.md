# Nemo's Inventory Sorting

**Nemo's Inventory Sorting** is a _client-side_ mod that adds buttons to your inventory GUI.  
Sort your inventory, move all matching or all items, or drop everything at once â€” all with a single click.

You can even filter and highlight items in containers by typing part of their name!

::: warning Disclaimer
This is a **client-only mod**, which means it can give you an advantage over other players.  
Using it on public servers _may_ get you banned depending on the serverâ€™s rules.  
Use at your own risk â€” or check with the server admins beforehand.
