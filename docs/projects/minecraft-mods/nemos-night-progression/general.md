# Nemo's Night Progression

With **Nemo's Night Progression**, the world keeps progressing while you sleep.
Sleeping no longer just skips the night - instead, it simulates the time that would have passed:

- Furnaces continue smelting as if the night had passed in real-time
- Crops & Trees grow by the amount of time skipped
