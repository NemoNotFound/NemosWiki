# How to Use

## Sorting

With **Nemo's Sorting**, you get buttons to sort items, move identical or all items, and drop items.

There are two ways to use these buttons:

### Mouse

Simply click the buttons, or **Shift-click** to include items in the hotbar.

### Keyboard

First, you need to set the key binds (they are unbound by default), which you can find in the key bind settings.  
Once configured, press the key bind — or **Shift + key bind** — to include hotbar items.

## Item Filter

Click the search bar to start searching for an item.  
You can search by **item name**, **custom name**, **enchantments**, or even for items inside **bundles** and **shulker boxes**.  
Click outside the search bar to stop searching.

You can also perform a quick search by pressing **Ctrl + F** (or **Command + F** on macOS). 
You can change the key binding in the settings.

## Enable Dark Mode

To enable dark mode, activate the **Dark Mode** resource pack.
