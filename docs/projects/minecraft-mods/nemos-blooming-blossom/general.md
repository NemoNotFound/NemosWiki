# Nemo's Blooming Blossom

**Nemo's Blooming Blossom** aims to improve vegetation and tree growth:

- Pink petals are generated around **cherry trees** as they grow.
- More petals are generated when **bone meal** is used on grass within a **cherry biome**.
- **Oak, birch, and dark oak trees** generate fallen leaves around them as they grow.
- **Flowers** can be obtained by using **bone meal** on flowers _(does not apply to wither roses)_.
