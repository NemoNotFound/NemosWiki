# Nemo's Backpacks

As the name suggests, Nemo’s Backpacks adds backpacks to Minecraft.
I know there are plenty of backpack mods out there, but I wanted to create my own **vanilla-style** take on them.

With Nemo’s Backpacks you get:

- 17 colors – all 16 dye variants plus a neutral default design
- 6 materials, each offering a different size:
  - Default → 9 slots
  - Copper → 18 slots
  - Iron → 27 slots
  - Gold → 36 slots
  - Diamond → 45 slots
  - Netherite → 54 slots

 You can place your backpack in the **dedicated backpack slot**.  
 A **visual indicator** will display which backpack you currently have equipped.

## Crafting

Backpacks are crafted with 8 leather surrounding a string, and can be upgraded using Upgrade Smithing Templates found throughout the world.
Upgrades must be applied step by step – you can’t skip directly to higher tiers!

## Keybinds

### Open or Close Backpack Inventory

**Default:** `I` — Opens or closes the backpack inventory.

### Swap Backpack Slot

**Default:** `B` — Swaps the currently equipped backpack slot.
