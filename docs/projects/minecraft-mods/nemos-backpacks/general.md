# Nemo's Backpacks

As the name suggests, Nemo’s Backpacks adds backpacks to Minecraft.
I know there are plenty of backpack mods out there, but I wanted to create my own **vanilla-style** take on them.

With Nemo’s Backpacks you get:
- 17 colors – all 16 dye variants plus a neutral default design
- 6 materials, each offering a different size:
    - Default → 9 slots
    - Copper → 18 slots
    - Iron → 27 slots
    - Gold → 36 slots
    - Diamond → 45 slots
    - Netherite → 54 slots

Backpacks are crafted with 8 leather surrounding a string, and can be upgraded using Upgrade Smithing Templates found throughout the world.
Upgrades must be applied step by step – you can’t skip directly to higher tiers!
